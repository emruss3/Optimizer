# Vertex-Attached Rotation Handle - Final Implementation

## ✅ **Fixed to Match Previous Reference Images**

### **🔧 Key Changes Made:**

#### **1. Handle Attached to Vertex**
- **Before**: Handle positioned above center of shape
- **After**: Handle attached to top-right vertex of the shape
- **Code**: Finds top-right vertex and positions handle relative to it

#### **2. Handle Moves With Shape**
- **Before**: Handle stayed in fixed position while shape rotated
- **After**: Handle moves with the shape as it rotates (attached to vertex)
- **Behavior**: Like the reference images - handle is "attached" to the shape

#### **3. Vertex-Based Rotation Center**
- **Before**: Rotation around shape center
- **After**: Rotation around the attached vertex
- **Code**: Uses `topRightVertex` as rotation center

### **🎯 Reference Image Behavior Achieved:**

1. **✅ Handle Position**: Attached to top-right vertex of the shape
2. **✅ Handle Movement**: Handle moves with the shape as it rotates
3. **✅ Connecting Line**: Dashed line from vertex to handle
4. **✅ Vertex Rotation**: Shape rotates around the attached vertex
5. **✅ Visual Attachment**: Handle appears "attached" to the shape

### **🔍 Technical Implementation:**

#### **Vertex Selection:**
```typescript
// Find the top-right vertex to attach the handle to
const topRightVertex = element.vertices.reduce((topRight, vertex) => {
  // Find the vertex that's most to the right and up
  if (vertex.x > topRight.x || (vertex.x === topRight.x && vertex.y < topRight.y)) {
    return vertex;
  }
  return topRight;
}, element.vertices[0]);
```

#### **Handle Positioning:**
```typescript
// Position handle above and to the right of the top-right vertex
const handleDistance = 50; // Distance from vertex
const handleX = topRightVertex.x + handleDistance;
const handleY = topRightVertex.y - handleDistance;
```

#### **Vertex-Based Rotation:**
```typescript
// Calculate initial angle from vertex to mouse position
const startAngle = Math.atan2(svgPoint.y - topRightVertex.y, svgPoint.x - topRightVertex.x);

// Use vertex as rotation center
setRotationCenter(topRightVertex);
```

### **📋 Expected Behavior (Like Reference Images):**

1. **Handle Position**: Rotation handle attached to top-right vertex
2. **Handle Movement**: Handle moves with the shape as it rotates
3. **Connecting Line**: Dashed line from vertex to handle
4. **Vertex Rotation**: Shape rotates around the attached vertex
5. **Visual Attachment**: Handle appears "attached" to the shape

### **🚀 Ready for Testing:**

The rotation handle should now behave exactly like the reference images:
- Handle attached to top-right vertex of the shape
- Handle moves with the shape as it rotates
- Shape rotates around the attached vertex
- Visual connection line from vertex to handle
- Handle appears "attached" to the shape

**This matches the vertex-attached behavior from your previous reference images!**
